# ubuntu-revive

The script ubuntu-revive aims to recreate a ubuntu installation in the event of failure by creating an unattended autoinstallable recovery ISO, that restores the installation of the failed installation into a newly initiated server install. This script borrows heavily from the ubuntu autoinstall script located at https://github.com/covertsh/ubuntu-autoinstall-generator.
