# ubuntu-revive

The script ubuntu-revive aims to recreate a ubuntu installation in the event of failure by creating an unattended autoinstallable recovery ISO, that restores the installation of the failed installation into a newly initiated server install. This script borrows heavily from the ubuntu autoinstall script located at https://github.com/covertsh/ubuntu-autoinstall-generator.    

This script was created for personal use, but it may be used for whatever purposes. Be careful as this script can nuke an existing installation! And it will probably have some bugs as well.
